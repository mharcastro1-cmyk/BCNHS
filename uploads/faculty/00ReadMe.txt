I made these Folder icons with Photoshop using images found on the net. They are fairly easy to make with basic PS knowledge, although it is time consuming due to the number of roster we have.

I don't mind you using them or sharing them, but please be respectful. I would hate to see some post showing a certain character being used as a Recycle Bin icon or any other degrading folder titles. Do that if you want to on your own, but the world don't need to know that you have a twisted mind.
Don't forget to credit (ctto) if you are sharing.

Happy gaming and be nice to other players.
